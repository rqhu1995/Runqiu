I am currently a Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Wai Yuen Szeto](https://www.civil.hku.hk/ceszeto/) at [Department of Civil Engineering](https://www.civil.hku.hk/), The University of Hong Kong. I graduated with a master's degree in Computer Technology in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/), Southeast University (China) in year 2021. 

During my master's study, I gained some background in knowledge representation and reasoning in AI, especially in the application of non-monotonic reasoning for decision support systems using answer set programming, and finding reasoning paths as the explanation for decision. 

My current research interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence, transportation engineering, and operations research. I am particularly interested in the application of multiobjective optimization in shared mobility systems, such as bike-sharing systems.
